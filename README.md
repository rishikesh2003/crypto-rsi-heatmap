## Todo (Help Wanted)

1. **Dynamic Coin Fetching:**
    - Update `data.py` to dynamically fetch coin data from Binance.
  
2. **Enhance Scatter Chart:**
    - Add colors for oversold and overbought regions.
    - Split the chart into smaller ones based on RSI ranges (0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, 80-100).
    - Fix the issue of chart reload when switching timeframes.
